# zenoqx

A partial port of [Stoix](https://github.com/EdanToledo/Stoix) from [Flax/Linen](https://flax-linen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox) for reinforcement learning research.

## Purpose

Personal learning project exploring RL/JAX/Equinox. This evaluates [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox) as an alternative to the still widely used [Flax Linen](https://flax-linen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), whose successor [NNX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nnx/index.html) hasn't clicked for me yet...

## Status

**Alpha** - Experimental, buggy, not production ready.

## Changelog

- **26.06.2025** - First commit
